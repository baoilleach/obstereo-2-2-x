=== How to use OBDotNet from IronPython ===

(1) Unzip the OBDotNet distribution

(2) Set the environment variable BABEL_DATADIR to point to the data folder contained within

You can test it by running IronPython in the OBDotNet folder:
>>> import clr
>>> clr.AddReference("OBDotNet")

To complete the installation:

(3) Add the OBDotNet distribution folder to the PATH environment variable

(4) Install the OBDotNet Assembly using "Control Panel", "Administrative Tools", "Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0", right-click "Assembly Cache", choose "Add", and find the OBDotNet.dll.

Now you should be able to run IronPython in any folder and the following should work:
>>> import clr
>>> clr.AddReference("OBDotNet")

Once the reference to OBDotNet has been added, you can import and use the OpenBabel bindings just like from CPython. The following lines calculate the molecular weight of propane:

>>> import OpenBabel as ob
>>> conv = ob.OBConversion()
>>> conv.SetInFormat("smi")
True
>>> mol = ob.OBMol()
>>> conv.ReadString(mol, "CCC")
True
>>> mol.GetMolWt()
44.09562
